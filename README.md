# OBSmini Hardware
This repository includes all the essential PCB and 3D printing files required for the OBSmini hardware.



## PCB

The Bill of Materials (BOM) and layout take inspiration from the reference designs mentioned in the schematic. 
However, they are primarily optimized for availability and cost-effectiveness, particularly for assembly services provided by JLCPCB.

"Basic Parts" are utilized whenever tolerances permit, while "Extended Parts" are employed only when absolutely necessary.

5 PCBs cost 50â‚¬ (including parts, assembly and shipping).
